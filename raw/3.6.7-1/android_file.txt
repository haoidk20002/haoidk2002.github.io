Ice Hockey Match

[PVZ_WORLDCUP_DES]
Gameplay Overview:
· A large number of zombies will appear in the game, among which zombies with a ball possession mark on their heads will score a goal when they reach our baseline.
· Players play as the plant side, set up formations, and after setting up the formation, plants that kill zombies with ball possession marks will gain ball possession plants food. Dragging the ice hockey plants food onto plants with ball possession marks will shoot the soccer ball.
· Dragging plants food onto plants without ball possession marks will pass the ball to the plant before shooting.
· The ice hockey continues to advance without zombie obstruction or killing zombies. If it advances to the baseline, the player scores one point.
· After the time is up, the side with more goals wins. In case of a draw, players can challenge again.
· Completing levels will earn rich rewards!

Event Rules:
1. Obtain Lucky Coins by purchasing packs or collecting bubbles. Add them to the Cornucopia to receive generous rewards. Lucky Coins are only valid for the current event and cannot be carried over to the next event. Use them promptly.
2. Each draw rewards Exchange Emblems and random prizes. Lucky participants have a chance to win the grand prize of 5000 Gems.
Guaranteed Rewards Probabilities:
Exchange Emblem ×1: 50.00%
Exchange Emblem ×2: 35.00%
Exchange Emblem ×3: 15.00%
Random Rewards Probabilities:
Gems ×10: 24.99% | Gems ×30: 8.33%
Gems ×50: 4.16% | Grand Prize Gems ×5000: 0.05%
Purple Plant Fragment ×1: 8.33% | Purple Plant Fragment ×2: 12.49%
Blue Plant Fragment ×2: 16.66% | Green Plant Fragment ×5: 24.99%
3. Purchase Lucky Packs to receive additional Lucky Coins, Cornucopia EXP, Gems, and more.
4. Complete daily tasks or purchase Lucky Packs to level up the Cornucopia, speeding up Lucky Coin production and unlocking higher exchange shop slots. The EXP required increases with levels, up to level 10. Cornucopia levels are valid only for the current event and do not carry over to the next.
5. The Cornucopia produces free Lucky Coins at intervals. Collect all available rewards by tapping any bubble. The higher the Cornucopia level, the faster it produces Lucky Coins. The interface can store up to 5 bubbles; no new bubbles will generate until the current ones are collected.
6. Use Exchange Emblems obtained from draws to redeem rewards like upgrade books and plant fragments in the exchange shop. Different items have different purchase limits and prices; some require a specific Cornucopia level to unlock. Exchange Emblems are valid only for the current event and cannot be carried over to the next. Use them promptly.
7. Each Cornucopia draw contributes to the server-wide prize pool. The initial pool is 10,000 Gems. For every 10 draws, the pool increases by 1 Gem. At the end of the event, the prize pool is distributed based on leaderboard rankings:
Top 1–50: 0.5% of the total pool per player (requires at least 200 draws)
Top 51–150: 0.25% per player (requires at least 160 draws)
Top 151–300: 0.2% per player (requires at least 120 draws)
Top 301–500: 0.1% per player (requires at least 80 draws)
(A minimum number of draws is required to qualify for the leaderboard.)

[CORNUCOPIA_PROGRESS_TIPS_INFO]
The prize pool increases by 1 Gem for every 10 server-wide Cornucopia draws.

{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}Wow, some amazing zombie has appeared.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE2_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}Be careful, these zombies aren't easy to deal with.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE3_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}Let me use my favourite Peashooter!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE4_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}What's going on? He's not taking any damage! What should I do?

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE5_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}My analysis has given me some interesting results.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE5_2]
{SAY:winnie}This is Dr. Zomboss' latest work. You'll need to find a way to break their Resilience to defeat him!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE5_3]
{SAY:winnie}Now the zombie is in a high resistance phase. Only by breaking the Resilience can normal damage be done.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE5_4]
{SAY:winnie}The yellow bar is the Resilience's value, do you see the icon on it?

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE6_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}Then I have to take a closer look.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE7_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}Each time they're hit by electric attacks, the Resilience is weakened, I have planted 5 Electric Peashooters for you. Have a look!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE8_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}The zombie is stunned, deal as much as damage as you can before he recovers!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE9_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}It's not easy!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE10_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}That's it! When encountering tough zombies, use plants with corresponding attributes to break down their Resilience faster!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE10_2]
{SAY:winnie}Certain plants do more damage to certain Resiliences than others, it's up to you to explore which are best!

[NARRATIVE_COPYCATS1_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}Penny, why are there so many magic hats here? Which one best suits me?

[NARRATIVE_COPYCATS2_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}Reports show that these hats hold more than meets the eye.

[NARRATIVE_COPYCATS2_2]

Rule Explanation

[DANGERROOM_REWARD_BTN_TXT]
Score Rewards

[DANGERROOM_RULE_TXT]
1. Endless Challenge mode is usually open on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, with adjustments on special holidays.

2. Each Endless Challenge period features a different world, and previews for the next world will be provided on non-open days. Recommended plants and the store for the upcoming world will also be listed.

3. The Endless Training Ground is now open! You can select the world you want to challenge in the training ground to hone your skills. Note that no points or medals are earned in training mode.

4. On open days, players can spend gems to reset Endless Challenge multiple times daily. On Saturdays and Sundays, players can reset once for free. Uncompleted challenges extend to the next open day but not the next cycle.

5. After passing a new level, players earn points: current points and the highest points of the period. Current points reset to 0 upon challenge reset, but the highest points persist. Leaderboards are based on the highest points of the period.

6. Passing a new level grants a medal. Medals can be used in the Medal Shop. Every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday at midnight, leaderboard rankings determine medal distribution.

7. Consecutive Endless challenges carry over sun quantity, Tactical Cuke, wheelbarrow quantity, artifact active uses, and remaining plants on the field to the next level. These values reset after a reset.

8. Tactical Cuke quantity is independent of other modes. 

9. Each plant has a usage limit; planting reduces the count, gradually recovering after each level. 

10. Every 5th level is a boss level. Before a boss level, there's an additional card draw for extra abilities. Players can choose one for free and spend gems for the second.

11. After the second challenge of the period, skipping levels is possible but limited to the highest level reached in that period.

12. Special zombies in Endless levels yield unique rewards and effects when defeated.

13. Active skills of all artifacts share a total use count in Endless Mode, switchable between levels. After exhausting uses, passive effects persist. Values reset after a reset.

{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie}You're not wrong, Dave, but according to the data, this doesn't connect to some giant plant-it connects to a new universe.

[NARRATIVE_TUTORIAL_ACCESSORY1_INTRO_3]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{PLAYFUL:crazydave}By the way, congratulations! Open the last page of the travel manual and see what rewards there are!

[NARRATIVE_ANNIVERSARY_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie}There are pumpkin heads and ghosts everywhere. You don't have to guess that Halloween is coming.

[NARRATIVE_ANNIVERSARY_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_2]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Actually, I'm also a ghost.

[NARRATIVE_ANNIVERSARY_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_3]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie}You need to say: "Actually, I'm a lazy man."

[NARRATIVE_ANNIVERSARY_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_4]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{EXCITED:crazydave}That's boring! Let's go to the Halloween party instead.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Hello chaps! Quite a jolly day ain't it?
 
[NARRATIVE_STEAM_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}It wasn't easy to get here, was it?
 
[NARRATIVE_STEAM_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}As a reward for your efforts, let me show you the power of industrial-era technology! Cheerio!
 
[NARRATIVE_STEAM_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Penny what did he just say? I can't speak british.
 
[NARRATIVE_STEAM_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{TIRED:winnie}Not sure, but he certainly has something deadly ready.
 
[NARRATIVE_STEAM_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_6]
{EXCITED:winnie}Set a timer, let's see how fast we can wreck his toys!
 
[NARRATIVE_STEAM_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Do you think you've won?
 
[NARRATIVE_STEAM_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}This is only the start.
 
[NARRATIVE_STEAM_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}Project Paradox may have failed, but I have worse ready for you. Until then, salutations.
 
[NARRATIVE_STEAM_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}He's quite good at bluffing, huh.
 
[NARRATIVE_STEAM_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{TIRED:winnie}I don't think he is right now, we need to be careful in the future.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Oh, mad one, do you think the plants you grow can stop the wheels of fate?

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}I intend to turn your garden into a domain for zombies.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}Before that, let us commence a grand performance!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{TIRED:crazydave}I didn't understand a word of that.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{EXCITED:winnie}He said he's going to take you down.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_6]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Maybe he's carrying tacos.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Ah, fate! Fate!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}All my efforts have been like a meteor streaking across the sky.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}You revel in fleeting joy, unaware that I shall return like lightning!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}I still don't understand.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{TIRED:winnie}Perhaps this is what they call a "Shakespearean" poetic defeat.


[NARRATIVE_CANNON_USE_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{SAY}This beauty can automatically shoot at incoming zombies for big damage!

[NARRATIVE_CANNON_USE_END_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{SAY}Those strong volleys require time to recharge, use them wisely and you'll be A-O-GOOD.

[NARRATIVE_POOYAN_CHOOSING_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{NPC_ENTER:winnieicon}{EXCITED:crazydaveicon}Woah, why has our ship landed?

[NARRATIVE_POOYAN_CHOOSING_2]
{SAY:winnieicon}It was running low on fuel, it should be refueling right now.

[NARRATIVE_POOYAN_CHOOSING_3]
{SAY:crazydaveicon}What about the zombies up there?

[NARRATIVE_POOYAN_CHOOSING_4]
{SAY:winnieicon}I've sent a team of expert plants up there with a smaller ship, your neighbor is up there too to keep them undetected from zombies down here.

[NARRATIVE_POOYAN_CHOOSING_5]
{SAY:winnieicon}As for us, we can hold the horde off ourselves.

[NARRATIVE_POOYAN_CHOOSING_6]
{TIRED:winnieicon}Hopefully.

[NARRATIVE_POOYAN_CHOOSING_7]
{SAY:crazydaveicon}Hey! I've got this pan for a reason!

[NARRATIVE_POOYAN_CHOOSING_7]
{SAY:winnieicon}In the meantime, i'll give your neighbor some help in choosing which plant team to pick.

[NARRATIVE_POOYAN_CHOOSED_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnieicon}{SAY:winnieicon}Great choice. Each plant team has different plants and attack methods.

[NARRATIVE_POOYAN_CHOOSED_2]
{SAY:winnieicon}After defeating enough zombies your plants will level up and become stronger.

[NARRATIVE_POOYAN_CHOOSED_3]
{SAY:winnieicon}Control your ship well, dodge the incoming fire and take down the incoming horde!

[NARRATIVE_POOYAN_ZOMBIE_GARGANTUAR_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}Greetings aircraftowner, I do believe you're flying in a no-fly zone. I have sent a Flying Gargantuar to personally escort you out safely.

[NARRATIVE_POOYAN_ZOMBIE_GARGANTUAR_2]
{NPC_ENTER:winnieicon}{SAY:winnieicon}Don't get near Flying Gargantuars!

[NARRATIVE_CARD_GAME_START_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Welcome to the new card mode. Use cards to win!

[NARRATIVE_CARD_GAME_START_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:crazydave}I can't wait to get started.

[NARRATIVE_CARD_GAME_END_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}That's it. Use the cards in your hand strategically to defeat the zombies.

[NARRATIVE_CARD_GAME_END_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Fantastic! I'm starting to understand everything.

[NARRATIVE_CARD_GAME_TURN2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Oh, it seems you got lucky. The combination of these cards will have incredible effects.

[NARRATIVE_CARD_GAME_TURN2_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Let me try it quickly.

[NARRATIVE_BESIEGE_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Penny, what's all this for?

[NARRATIVE_BESIEGE_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:winnie}I extended the airship's deck. You should be able to do repairs safely now.

[NARRATIVE_BESIEGE_INTRO_3]
{SAY:crazydave}Sweet!

[NARRATIVE_BESIEGE_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Neighbor! Make sure no zombies interferes!

[NARRATIVE_BESIEGE_INTRO_5]
{SAY:winnie}Dr. Zomboss is sending his fleet towards us.

[NARRATIVE_BESIEGE_INTRO_6]
{EXCITED:winnie}Don't let them steal our parts.

[NARRATIVE_BOX_SHOVELED_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{SAY}You know how to bust those boxes real well!

[NARRATIVE_BOX_SHOVELED_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:winnieicon}{PLAYFUL}Don't worry about the details!

[NARRATIVE_BOX_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{SAY}Penny found some boxes.

[NARRATIVE_BOX_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{SAY}Let's see what we can use them for.

[NARRATIVE_BOX_PLANTED_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{EXCITED}Well done!

[NARRATIVE_BOX_PLANTED_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{SAY}Look! The zombies' attack route has changed.

[NARRATIVE_BOX_PLANTED_INTRO_3]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{SAY}Use the boxes to block the zombies' advance!

[NARRATIVE_BOX_PLANTED_INTRO_4]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{SAY}Then, plant and defend against the zombie horde!

[NARRATIVE_PLANT_LVLUP_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnieicon}{SAY}You can use sun to upgrade plants.

[NARRATIVE_GAMESTART_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnieicon}{SAY}Now the plants have become stronger. You can upgrade up to 3 times!

[NARRATIVE_GAMESTART_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{PLAYFUL}Uh oh, I see a horde coming up. Set up those plants well neighbor!

[NARRATIVE_SHOWREGINSKY_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnieicon}{SAY}Only flying plants can be planted in the sky area outside the airship.

[NARRATIVE_SHOWSHIPHEALTH_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnieicon}{SAY}When the airship is attacked, its durability decreases. If it's depleted, well...

[NARRATIVE_SHOWSHIPHEALTH_INTRO_2]
{TIRED:winnieicon}You will die.

[NARRATIVE_SHOWTHUNDER_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnieicon}{SAY}Thunderstorms will strike your plants from time to time, applying either a positive or negative electric charge.

[NARRATIVE_SHOWTHUNDER_INTRO_1]
{SAY:winnieicon}Two charges being combined leads to devastating effects!

[NARRATIVE_PLANTTHUNDER_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{SAY}Please plant according to the arrow prompts.

[NARRATIVE_PLANTTRIAL_PLANT_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY}{CONTENT}.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Woah! Welcome to the jungle!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}User Dave, this is no ordinary jungle. A scan of my records indicates that this is the fabled Lost City.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}Historical texts state that the Sun was worshipped here. Resources should be plentiful.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}I suggest that we try planting on the Gold Tiles that we find here.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_5]
{SAY:winnie}They should continuously generate sun as long as they have plants on them.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_6]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Lost City? This is it Penny! We've found it!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_7]
{SAY:crazydave}Where else would I find my lost taco, except in a Lost City?

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_8]
{SAY:winnie}Your continued fixation defies all logic or reason, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_16_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Come here seeking adventure, have you?

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_16_INTRO_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}Unfortunately for you, the Porter Gargantuars are about to ruin your day!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_16_INTRO_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}They carry imps. Imps! Prepare to become ancient history!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_16_INTRO_4]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}I wish someone would carry me around in a tiny house!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_16_INTRO_5]
{SAY:winnie}I wish for a lot of things, User Dave. That is not one of them.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_17_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Alert, User Dave! My sensors sense incoming Imp Porters.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_17_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Importers? Of fine goods and glassware?

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_17_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}Negative. They pitch tents on Gold Tiles, and the tents spawn zombies.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_17_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Imps with bad inTENTs!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}My sensors indicate movement incoming from above.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_2_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Maybe it's presents. Presents from the sky!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_2_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}The chances of that statement being true are statistically irrelevant.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}I believe it to be a new form of zombie threat. We should be cautious of unexpected guests.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_22_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Beware, User Dave! I detect trap tiles.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_22_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}They are triggered by zombies, or when you plant on them.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_22_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave}And then they give you tacos?

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_22_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}If you equate tacos with jets of flame and huge boulders, then yes.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}We are facing considerable threats, User Dave. I suggest that we retaliate with tremendous force.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_3_INTRO_2]
{SAY:crazydave}More forceful! That's it! We'll give them all a stern talking to.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_3_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}I was referring to the Lava Guava. Its explosive blasts leave behind dangerous magma.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_3_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:crazydave}That sounds even better! First a stern talking, then some lava!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_4_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Caution, User Dave. I detect a zombie with a shovel.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_4_INTRO_2]
{SAY:crazydave}What can he dig up?

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_4_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}It appears to block incoming shots. We need a way to get projectiles over the shovel.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_4_INTRO_4]
{SAY:crazydave}I know! TELEKINESIS!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_4_INTRO_5]
{SAY:winnie}Try again, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}Do not think to usurp our discovery of the fabled Lost City!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}I and my zombies have already submitted our find to the Eminent Journal of the Missing and the Mislaid!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}We will publish and you will PERISH!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Look, Penny! Something shiny!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{SAY:winnie}My detector indicates that this amulet points to a challenging path.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Let's discover a new continent!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}All that discovering and still no taco!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:winnie}The search will no doubt continue, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{NPC_EXIT:crazydave}{NPC_EXIT:winnie}{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}My discovery remains intact. The taco is still unfound. And your brains will certainly one day be mine!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_ZOMBIENOTE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Well lookie-here, Penny! It's a treasure map!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_ZOMBIENOTE_2]
{SAY:winnie}My analysis suggests that the origins of that map are highly suspect.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_ZOMBIENOTE_3]
{SAY:crazydave}It has a big red X on it, Penny. When have big red Xs ever been bad?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_ZOMBIENOTE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{NPC_ENTER:winnieicon}{EXCITED:crazydaveicon}Look! Is this a magic scroll?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_ZOMBIENOTE_2]
{SAY:winnieicon}My analysis indicates that this paper doesn't have any magical fluctuations.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_ZOMBIENOTE_3]
{SAY:crazydaveicon}But there are many unfamiliar symbols here.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_ZOMBIENOTE_4]
{SAY:winnieicon}Knowledge gives us the ability to judge right from wrong...

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BANANA_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}User Dave. Please note the line of Banana Launchers.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BANANA_2]
{EXCITED:WINNIE}They appear to need our protection!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BANANA_3]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Let's get to it! After all, bananas are a very a-PEELING fruit!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BANANA_4]
{TIRED:WINNIE}User Dave, if I had a head, I would be shaking it right now.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BOWLING_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}My research shows that bowling is the trendiest sport of this era.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BOWLING_2]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Do you agree with me, Penny?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BOWLING_3]
{TIRED:WINNIE}I can't decipher your thought process, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BOWLING_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}I'm thinking using Bowling Bulbs here would be great.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BOWLING_5]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Heh. I was just thinking about how much I love wearing bowling shoes.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BOWLING_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Wearing those bright and colorful shoes...on my feet!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_CHOMPER_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}When dealing with zombies from the deep sea...

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_CHOMPER_2]
{PLAYFUL:WINNIE}...we need a plant with an appetite as fierce as a shark.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_CHOMPER_3]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}I got it, Penny! You're talking about the Chomper!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_CHOMPER_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}Exactly. Its sharp teeth can turn the tide of battle.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_CHOMPER_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Hey, I have an idea too! Let's call it Chomper Week!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_CHOMPER_6]
{TIRED:WINNIE}If we must, User Dave. If we must.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{PLAYFUL}Sun! Islands! Beaches! Bikinis! Taco! Here I come!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Everything the plants need to grow is here!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_3]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}We have sunlight, sandy soil, and plenty of water!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}Warning. My sensors indicate zombies on your beach...

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_5]
{SAY:WINNIE}...and there's way too much water. It will drown the plants.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_6]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}What's the problem? We just need some Lily Pads.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_7]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Then all the other plants can float on the water!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_8]
{PLAYFUL:WINNIE}Or as they say here, they can "ride the waves" on Lily Pads.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_9]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Exactly, Penny! Exactly!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY}Listen up, puny plants! I'm here to rain on your parade.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_2]
{SAY}There's a terrifying monster in the depths...

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_3]
{SAY}And when it surfaces, it's going to claim your brains!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_4]
{SAY}Get ready to be crushed! All hail Dr. Zomboss!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_5]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}That guy is tough.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_6]
{TIRED:WINNIE}And annoying, User Dave. Quite annoying.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_ALT_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY}You're all in deep trouble now!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_ALT_2]
{SAY}The gooey-eyed Deep Sea Giants have their sights set on you.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_ALT_3]
{SAY}You can run! You can swim!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_ALT_4]
{SAY}But you won't escape their clutches!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_ALT_5]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Uh, that guy is tough.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_ALT_6]
{TIRED:WINNIE}And annoying, User Dave. Quite annoying.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE}Let me tell you, Penny. These surfing zombies are real troublemakers!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Ponder on this phrase: "troublemakers"...

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_3]
{PLAYFUL:WINNIE}Hmm. Trouble. Quite amusing, isn't it, User Dave? You're a genius!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Really?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_5]
{TIRED:WINNIE}No, you're not. But you did give me an idea.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_6]
{EXCITED:WINNIE}Guacodile! This plant can launch pits at zombies.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_7]
{SAY:WINNIE}And it's particularly fond of biting.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_8]
{EXCITED:WINNIE}Place it on the front lines.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE}Yo! It's not easy to resist the zombie army that surges like a tide.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Do you know what we need, Penny? We need a partner with a lot of substance!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}By substance, I mean attitude. Let me translate it for you in case you didn't understand.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}Then I suggest getting the Homing Thistle to help.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_5]
{SAY:WINNIE}I believe it has the kind of substance you're talking about.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Its eyes! So bright! Just one glare can kill those zombies!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_7]
{EXCITED:WINNIE}And more importantly, it can shoot deadly darts that track their targets.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_8]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}With just this plant, we can deliver a double blow! So awesome!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_TIDES_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Tides rise, tides fall. Can someone explain?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_TIDES_5]
{TIRED:WINNIE}That's a scientific question, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Hey beach boy! Stop talking nonsense.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}But have you noticed how close the Chomper and Bikini Zombie are?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Could a romantic beach story be brewing between plants and zombies?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Speaking of that, how loyal are you to the Chomper?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}I couldn't help but notice... it has an appetite as big as a zombie's.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_6]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Enjoy chewing on those land lovers! To be continued!
- Dr. Zomboss

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_7]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}A romantic story between plants and zombies? Penny... my head is about to explode!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_8]
{SAY:WINNIE}User Dave, let's not jump to conclusions. I suggest trying a more effective approach.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_9]
{EXCITED:WINNIE}Let's act quickly!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:WINNIE}Alert! I've detected a mysterious statue.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Look over there! It's a Tiki statue. It has a crazy look in its eyes.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Analysis indicates that this Tiki might launch a terrifying challenge to anyone who follows it.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}So you're saying they'll encounter a Tiki-nado? Get it? Tiki-nado?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_5]
{TIRED:WINNIE}User Dave, I must admit, your puns are... Tiki-rrible.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}"Romantic story between plants and zombies? Absolutely crazy!"

{SHOUT:CRAZYDAVE}When it comes to craziness, I'm an expert!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}I agree. I suspect Dr. Zomboss is about to plant unsettling seeds.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}From now on, we can only sow here!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{NPC_EXIT:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_EXIT:WINNIE}{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Nonsense! You have no idea what I have prepared for you!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_6]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}The seeds of destruction have been planted! Get ready to be annihilated!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_7]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}But for now, I must take my leave. I'll be back later to deal with you idiots!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_ZOMBIENOTE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVEICON}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVEICON}Look! It must be time to play Beach Zombie Bungo!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_ZOMBIENOTE_2]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIEICON}{EXCITED:WINNIEICON}Bingo, User Dave. It's BINGO.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_ZOMBIENOTE_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVEICON}You already won, Penny? Wow. You're good at this!

[NARRATIVE_BEGHOULED_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}I've detected a grid of plants, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_BEGHOULED_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}My scanning device shows that you can swap their positions for a match-three elimination game.

[NARRATIVE_BEGHOULED_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I've seen this kind of game on my phone!

[NARRATIVE_BEGHOULED_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}You can use sunlight to upgrade the plants.

[NARRATIVE_BEGHOULED_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE}Eliminate 100 matches to defeat the zombies!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY}Hello there, Plant Thief,

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}The spies have marked your brains as my property.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_3]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Greetings, Dr. Zomboss.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_4]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}I don't want anyone marking my brain.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_5]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Cleaning them up won't be easy.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}Have you considered that you've caught Crazy Dave's crazy?

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}There's no zombie uprising that poses a threat to you.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}You don't even need plants to defend your home.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}I and those zombies are just ordinary people trying to help you.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}I bet you'll also say 'nothing outside the heart' to us!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_NEW_OUTRO_LASTTLEVEL_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}{START_DIALOG_MUSIC}User Dave, it's time to saddle up and leave.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_NEW_OUTRO_LASTTLEVEL_2]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SPECIAL14}There's a sunset. Let's ride!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_NEW_OUTRO_LASTTLEVEL_3]
{EXCITED:WINNIE}Where do you think the future will take us?

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_NEW_OUTRO_LASTTLEVEL_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}The Future you say?

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_NEW_OUTRO_LASTTLEVEL_5]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}We should take another look at my Time-Space Taco Map.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}My Uncle Milo used to have one these, he called it a boom box.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Actually, that's close enough. I'll allow it.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Maybe we can use it to free our minds.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_2]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}I still have some cleaning to do.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}It'd be best to use it to enter a new world.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_4]
{TIRED:WINNIE}You know, it's better...

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Taco! I almost forgot!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Exactly! These plants will deal with you and your zombies.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}We haven't even started seriously yet...

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Although those things do exist!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}I admit you're right.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}We don't have any disagreement about being serious.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVEICON}{START_DIALOG_MUSIC}That looks very futuristic.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_2]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVEICON}User Dave, the one who believes in the future, will surely understand the true meaning of Taco.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_3]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIEICON}I detected high-speed moving hyper-light particles.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:WINNIEICON}Maybe it's future Penny trying to contact us.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_5]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}Hello, time travelers.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_6]

{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_12]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVEICON}That Mr. Boss guy seems like a really nice fellow!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_13]
{TIRED:WINNIEICON}We should be wary of that one User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_14]
{SAY:WINNIEICON}In the meantime...

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_15]
{EXCITED:WINNIEICON}Earning Stars will prepare you for Star Gates we find later!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_16]
{SAY:WINNIEICON}Also, Endless Challenges will keep you sharp for future trials.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_17]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVEICON}{SPECIAL15}Just remember. Tomorrow is always a taco...

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_18]
{SPECIAL16:CRAZYDAVE}And a taco is what we find inside of all of us.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_EVILPOTIONS_1]

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_EVILPOTIONS_2]
{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE}Can you help me translate this into Crazy Dave language?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_EVILPOTIONS_3]
{TIRED:WINNIE}There are evil potions on the lawn!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_EVILPOTIONS_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Evil medieval potions! The most dangerous kind...

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_EVILPOTIONS_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Twice as evil as they should be!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_5]
{SAY:WINNIE}And the sky no longer showers sunlight.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_6]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}We need someone to light up this place!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_7]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I got it! We need Sun-shrooms!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_8]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}These guys not only make people smile...

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_9]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}But also produce more sunlight! Brilliant, my friends, simply genius.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FUMESHROOM_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE}I'm afraid the Dark Ages have given me a severe case of steam sickness.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FUMESHROOM_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}User Dave, steam sickness is no longer considered a real illness.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FUMESHROOM_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}But I believe Fume-shrooms should come in handy.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FUMESHROOM_4]
{EXCITED:WINNIE}Its fumes are quite convincing and provide an advantage against specific zombie enemies.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FUMESHROOM_5]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Awesome! It's time for those zombies to taste the steam sickness!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY}Nice to meet you, not-so-noble noble!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}According to my professional medical opinion, your sense of humor is slightly off!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_3]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}The only cure is to suck out your brains!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_4]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}You'll feel light as a feather, Dr. Zomboss.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_5]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Hey! I like that my sense of humor has nothing to do with my brain!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Because I'm crazy!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_HYPNOSHROOM_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:WINNIE}Data indicates that the Dark Ages is an era of intellectual degeneration and moral decay.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_HYPNOSHROOM_2]
{PLAYFUL:WINNIE}Perhaps it's time for Hypno-shroom to unleash its power?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_HYPNOSHROOM_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Great idea, Penny! Let's give the evil Dark Ages a makeover!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_HYPNOSHROOM_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}After consuming this mushroom, the zombies won't know what bit them...

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_HYPNOSHROOM_5]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Until they realize it was their own zombie comrades! Then they'll be stunned!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_MAGNETSHROOM_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}According to my data, iron and other metals are commonly used during the Dark Ages.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_MAGNETSHROOM_2]
{EXCITED:WINNIE}Therefore, Magnet-shroom should prove useful.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_MAGNETSHROOM_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}It can attract buckets, helmets, and other metal objects from the zombies!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_MAGNETSHROOM_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Some people think it's magic, but it's really just physics.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_PEANUT_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Kid, both Peashooters and Wall-nuts are pretty formidable.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_PEANUT_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}When these two great plants team up, they become even greater!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_PEANUT_3]
{EXCITED:WINNIE}User Dave, maybe your brain isn't as abnormal as you claim!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_PEANUT_4]
{PLAYFUL:WINNIE}Is there a plant that can combine the powers of Peashooter and Wall-nut?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_PEANUT_5]
{SAY:winnie}We would call it a ... Pea-nut!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_PEANUT_6]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Two plant powers in one legume's body?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_PEANUT_7]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Keep talkin' like that and people are going to call you Crazy Penny!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_PEANUT_8]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Then we'd both be quite strange.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY}A question for you, my Ignoble Foes!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Hast thou noted how violent thine plants become upon consuming Plant Food?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Perchance, hast thou wondered what Plant Food is truly made of?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Verily, I shall tell thee. It's zombies! Plant food is made out of zombies!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Unpossible! We feed our plants only the highest quality organic uhm...

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_6]
{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE}Hey Penny, what is Plant Food made of?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_7]
{SAY:WINNIE}I fear the true nature of Plant Food requires further analysis, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_8]
{TIRED:WINNIE}Excuse me while I run some tests.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Why would someone put such a good sword into a dirty stone?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{TIRED:WINNIE}I think it's a test, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]
{EXCITED:WINNIE}Only those with great strength and unwavering will can pull the sword out.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}I bet someone could solve it with a power drill.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}As long as that person is crazy enough!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_6]
{TIRED:WINNIE}It's a crude method, but apparently effective, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}I didn't find any zombies or zombie-related ingredients in the Plant Food.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE}Whoa! Plants shouldn't eat zombies who eat plants.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Except for Chomper. It's got no choice. Fiber is essential.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_EXIT:WINNIE}{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}What do you think of that broken time machine?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Shall we discuss this another time?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_6]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}For now, imagine my maniacal laughter as I depart.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Alert, User Dave. My sensors indicate we have moved 153,954,765 years into the past.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_1_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Wow! I wasn't even born then!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Correct. It seems we've entered a Jurassic swamp.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_1_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}No wonder I can smell more oxygen!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_15_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Look, Penny! A dancing star!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_15_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}That's a meteor. Interesting. Records show it should be... bigger.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_15_OUTRO_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE} Bigger? Like, super burrito-sized?

[NARRATIVE_DINO_15_OUTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}More like super Seattle-sized. I hope history has not gone awry...

[NARRATIVE_DINO_16_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Put your brains aside, it's time for some madness!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_16_INTRO_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Or wait to face the same fate as those terrifying electric dinosaurs: extinction!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_16_INTRO_3]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}But I don't want to be extinct!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_17_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}...Sigh...

[NARRATIVE_DINO_17_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}What's wrong, User Dave?

[NARRATIVE_DINO_17_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I just always wanted a primitive sunflower who gave big suns!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_17_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}Your wish is about to come true, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}This era is known for its unusual life forms, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_2_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I know! You're talking about gymnosperms, right?

[NARRATIVE_DINO_2_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}I'm referring to reptiles, User Dave. Dinosaurs.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}As long as we don't provoke them, they won't attack us.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_2_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE}But they will definitely react to zombies. Be careful!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_21_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Beware the Jurassic Bully zombies, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_21_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}They are immune to the Primal Peashooter's knockback effect.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_21_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Huh? But how is that possible? Even the Gargantuars get knocked back!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_21_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}It's true, User Dave. The Gargantuars are too dumb to follow basic physics rules.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_23_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}I detect Primal Potato Mines nearby, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_23_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}They possess ancient power that predates even our most advanced modern technology.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_23_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Smashed potatoes? I love it!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_6_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I can feel the earth shaking, Penny! More dinosaurs are coming?

[NARRATIVE_DINO_6_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}That's right, User Dave. A group of Stegosauruses is approaching.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_6_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}My sensors show that they can use their tails to grab zombies and fling them away.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_6_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I love it!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_8_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}I've analyzed a new plant, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_8_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}The Perfume-shroom can charm dinosaurs and make them fight against zombies.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_8_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Dinosaur power at our disposal? This is even better news than buttered corn!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_9_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Penny! I just realized how much I love silent letters!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_9_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Funny you mention that, User Dave. A group of Pterodactyls is approaching.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_9_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Pterodactyls? That's amazing, simply amazing!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Now you've really ticked me off!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Can you please stop messing around with your foolish methods?

[NARRATIVE_DINO_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Stay put and wait. I have a huge rock I want to introduce you to.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}I hate little rocks!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I found a footprint! It's huge and scary!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}This footprint of a Velociraptor indicates that we have entered an ancient dinosaur arena, User Dave!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}I detected a meteor shower approaching, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}I suggest we evacuate this time-space immediately.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Goodbye, dinosaurs! You're about to become birds soon!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_EXIT:WINNIE}{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}Bah! You leave me no choice but to enact... Project Paradox!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_6]
{TIRED:WINNIE}This is not a good sign.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY}Have you ever wondered why your neighbor, User Dave, is always so hungry?

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}What secret ingredient in the buttered corn makes him crave it endlessly?

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Could he desire your brains just like us?

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}What - ?! Impossible. I would never eat a corn made of brains!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE}But... I also don't remember what's inside...

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:WINNIE}Though tetrahedrons are pyramids, this one is not a Platonic solid.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I'm so hungry, I would love a Platonic solid.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]
{TIRED:WINNIE}User Dave, this is also not a taco salad.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Look, Penny! A Pirate Key! It's pirate-y!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_2]
{EXCITED:WINNIE}This will enable us to travel to another time.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_3]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Sounds salty! Taco... ahoyyyy!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{PLAYFUL}Wait a moment!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE}There's never been any meat in that taco.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}There are still crumbs in my mustache as evidence!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Well, this will leave us with more brains... but not now.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}No matter when or where, I will find you again!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_WORLDMAP_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVEICON}{SPECIAL3}Let's go find my taco!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_WORLDMAP_INTRO_6]
{TIRED:WINNIEICON}...

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_WORLDMAP_INTRO_OLD_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVEICON}{EXCITED}Good news! Penny found a map that leads to my taco!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_WORLDMAP_INTRO_OLD_2]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIEICON}{TIRED}No, that's a spacetime map. It marks the plants that can help us.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_WORLDMAP_INTRO_OLD_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVEICON}{SPECIAL3}Let's go find my taco!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_WORLDMAP_INTRO_OLD_4]
{TIRED:WINNIEICON}...

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Wait! I remember smelling this scent when I used to chase squirrels as a kid!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}That's right, User Dave. It seems like we've arrived in the rock era.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}I suspect the rhythm of the music might affect the speed of the zombies.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_1_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I'm feeling the groove, I'm feeling the groove!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_15_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Someone passed me a small note in the classroom, Penny!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_15_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}It says to meet behind the bike shed during recess for a big surprise!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_15_OUTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}I suspect that note is suspicious, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_16_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Do you feel that you have grooved? Did you bang your head? Have you "dug it"?

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_16_INTRO_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Now the party is over! Melt before the musical might of my majestic Hair Metal Gargantuar!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_16_INTRO_3]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I'm scared, Penny! It's two minutes to midnight!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_16_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}Be brave, User Dave. We'll jilt this ditty... on rock and roll!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_17_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Hmm! Penny, do you smell something strange?

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_17_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}No, User Dave. Only Breakdancer Zombies.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_17_INTRO_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Maybe they're garlic-flavored!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Be careful, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}I believe some special zombies will have unique abilities when they hear their favorite music.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_2_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}So you're saying they go even crazier when they're already crazy?

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}Yes, exactly, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_22_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}The Spore-shroom has a special ability, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_22_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}After defeating a zombie, it will spawn a new Spore-shroom in its place.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_22_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Whoa! More mushrooms with the Spore-shroom!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_26_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}So, Penny, do you think we can use the Intensive Carrot to bring back dead plants?

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_26_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Um... absolutely, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_26_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Sorry. Your intense focus confuses me sometimes.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I got a real Cactus feeling about this, Penny!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_3_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Actually, the Cactus has changed over time, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_3_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Now it deals ranged damage with its spines but also hides and deals ground damage when zombies get close.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_3_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}That's so Cactus... always varying her attack and defensive profiles!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Hmm... You're in danger up there. You're a fool, I knew it!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_INTRO_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Listen carefully: you will give up in the end, you will be disappointed, you always run around, and I will make you behave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_INTRO_3]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}I will make you cry, I will bid you farewell, I am not a good person-I warn you!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_INTRO_4]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Ouch!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}Yikes! That was close... so many exciting beats and rhythm changes!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}I'm afraid we only hit the pause button on Dr. Zomboss's conspiracy for now.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_OUTRO_3]
{NPC_EXIT:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_EXIT:WINNIE}{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}Yeah, the next song will be even worse! You can't imagine how bad!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Penny! Penny! Penny! A microphone!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}It's karaoke time! My citrus dream is finally coming true!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Be careful, User Dave. Suddenly finding this microphone might unleash chaos once again!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Penny! These plants can swap positions!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_1_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}That's right, User Dave. You can swap the positions of plants to make matches of three or more.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}You need to make 125 matches to defeat the zombies.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_1_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}You can use sun to upgrade your plants.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:WINNIE}I found three different power-up items, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}They are Power Shuffle, Power Shovel, and Power Zap.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Power Shuffle scrambles the board if you are having trouble finding a match.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}Power Shovel fills in a crater, allowing an eaten plant to be replaced.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE}Power Zap power zaps zombies.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_6]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}The last one completely confused me!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}We have to switch positions so many times, Penny!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_3_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Indeed, it's going to be a long battle, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_3_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}But my sensors detect that if we can hold on, we'll receive great rewards.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_3_INTRO_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Stay calm and keep swapping!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_5_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Whoa! That field looks all wrinkled like an overcooked sausage!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_5_OUTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}That's right, User Dave. But our efforts should bring us generous coin rewards.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Alert, User Dave! My battery is running low.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}But you need to use power to open or close the windows!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}That's correct. Maybe using some electrified plants can help me recharge.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_1_INTRO_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}That sounds logical. It might work!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}I have detected a plant called Electric Currant, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}If you plant two of them in the same row or column, they create an electric field between them.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_2_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}The electric field damages zombies and charges my battery.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}What an amazing invention!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_4_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}I have detected minecarts, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_4_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Use them along with the electric field from Electric Currant to shock the zombies.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_4_INTRO_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}That's a great idea!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_5_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}This electricity is giving me beard shocks! Can we take a break at the beach?

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_5_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Of course, User Dave. Get ready for an onslaught at the beach party.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_5_INTRO_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Can we have some bananas?

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_5_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}Bananas are served.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_6_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}How are your batteries, Penny?

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_6_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Fully charged, User Dave. Thanks for asking.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_6_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Electric Currant has been really helpful.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_6_INTRO_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Unlimited power!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_9_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Watch out for falling boulders.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_9_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Once triggered, they'll destroy both plants and zombies.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:WINNIE}My battery is almost fully charged, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_INTRO_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Wowza! So much electricity!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_OUTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}It will add another outstanding new member to our collection.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}The Electric Currant sparks and shimmers, dazzlingly!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Indeed, its electrical energy brings boundless vitality.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Attention, User Dave! I've detected a soundwave signal. There are a bunch of zombie gems somewhere.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}You found them hidden so well, huh?

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}If we act fast, maybe we can snatch them.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_1_INTRO_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Gems, oh yeah, they're mine!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_10_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Those gems are within reach. I can smell them!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_10_INTRO_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Just like the scent of spring currants!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_10_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Whew! You scoundrel! A thief of gems!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_10_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}No worries! My plan is progressing swiftly!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_6_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}The zombies have learned about our gem plan, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_6_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}They intend to attack from the sea.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_6_INTRO_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Battle at sea! Roll out the bowling bubbles!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}I smell leather! And electricity too!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}My sensors have tracked down the lost plants in time.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}I smell rescue! And oranges too!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}The lost plant we're searching for is Gold Bloom, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Once planted, it immediately produces a large amount of sun!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_2_INTRO_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Immediately producing sun? Not fast enough! It should be even faster!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_2_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Gold Bloom will disappear after some time, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_2_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Fortunately, I can track it no matter where it goes.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_2_OUTRO_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Hang in there, little sprout! We're coming!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_7_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}We did it! I'm the hero of all plants!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_7_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Those strange teleporters have me worried, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_7_OUTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}I believe some evil conspiracy is brewing.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_7_OUTRO_4]
{NPC_EXIT:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_EXIT:WINNIE}{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Hah! Hahaha! Ha!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_7_OUTRO_5]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Very interesting!

[NARRATIVE_ESCAPEROOT_LOD_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Tap the Escape Root, then tap another plant, to make them switch places.

[NARRATIVE_ESCAPEROOT_LOD_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}When zombies get near, the Escape Root explodes.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_LASTSTAND_A_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}I like saving up some sun for a rainy day.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_LASTSTAND_A_2]
{TIRED:WINNIE}It can get you out of a pickle or into an E.M.Peach.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_PRESET_A_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY}Friends can choose, but these plants can't.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_PRESET_A_2]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}But I have some of the best friends who happen to be plants!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_PRESET_B_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{TIRED}It seems we lack firepower, Penny.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_PRESET_B_2]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY}With a good supply of sun...

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_PRESET_B_3]
{EXCITED:WINNIE}Magnifying Grass can pack quite the punch.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_PROTECTPLANTS_A_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Protect those charged Citrons!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_PROTECTPLANTS_A_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}It's not easy to hold the line like that.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_3]
{TIRED:WINNIE}...

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Hey, what's up with the lawn? It's so bright and shiny!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_5]
{SAY:WINNIE}I detected a row of reinforced tiles on the lawn.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY}Welcome back, gardener,

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Your brain was taken away years ago.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_3]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}We'll take care of it very soon, Dr. Zomboss.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_4]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Watch out, neighbor! I'm pretty sure he's not talking about my brain!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_5]
{PLAYFUL:WINNIE}But I think there is evidence suggesting the opposite.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}Isn't it good to have your neighbor helping you fight zombies?

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}The usefulness of Crazy Dave pales in comparison.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}But if I say the passphrase, my undercover spy will turn against you.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Listen to me David, "Hypno-Zombnosis".

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SPECIAL1}Hello, neighbor!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_6]
{PLAYFUL}Can I borrow your brain? Uh, I mean hot sauce!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_MAGNIFYING_GRASS_FAILURE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY}Oh no, you really should try again!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_MANUAL_MOWERS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}You can decide to use a lawn mower earlier.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_MANUAL_MOWERS_2]
{EXCITED:WINNIE}Seize the opportunity, hold down on the lawn mower.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_MANUAL_MOWERS_3]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Sometimes, that's the most logical thing to do!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I spy with my crazy eye a U.F.B.! An unidentified flying brain!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Inside, there are things scarier than a brain.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{SPECIAL2}Oh! It's truly incredible!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I want to eat that hypnotizing corn again! I need my time machine!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE}What? Wait... What did I just say?

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Hypno-Zombnosis... Hypno-ZOMBNOSIS!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Drats, or was it Zombno-Hypsosis?

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_ZOMBIENOTE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVEICON}{SAY}Looks like there's a problem. Can you come and fix it, Penny?

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_ZOMBIENOTE_2]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIEICON}{TIRED}Did you try pulling it out and plugging it back in?

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_CHARDGUARD_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}These cave zombies are really stubborn!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_CHARDGUARD_2]
{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE}They never accept the answer "no brains"!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_CHARDGUARD_3]
{PLAYFUL:WINNIE}According to my data, the skulls of these cave zombies are 33.2% harder than other zombies.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_CHARDGUARD_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}I suggest deploying the Chard Guard. It has a hidden special move.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_CHARDGUARD_5]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}You mean his ol' Knock 'Em Dead maneuver?

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_CHARDGUARD_6]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}It can knock those zombies back to their homes!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_CHARDGUARD_7]
{TIRED:WINNIE}I guess that's not a secret anymore, so this is User Dave, right?

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_FIREPEASHOOTER_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:WINNIE}Alert, alert, User Dave! My defense, offe, freeze sprays aren't enough!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_FIREPEASHOOTER_2]
{TIRED:WINNIE}If my system gets fro, fro, fro, frozen, we'll be stuck here forever!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_FIREPEASHOOTER_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Even if it's doomsday, I won't let that happen, Penny!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_FIREPEASHOOTER_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}It's time to unleash the Fire Peashooter!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_FIREPEASHOOTER_5]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}She can release heat at zombies and keep nearby friends warm!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_8]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Don't worry! We'll strategically plant them to block the zombie cold wave!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_FLAMETHROWER_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE}I hate global cooling! We need some heat waves!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_FLAMETHROWER_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Agreed. Remember, I've replaced snowballs with fireballs.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_FLAMETHROWER_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Flamethrower enhancements can melt ice and damage zombies!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_FLAMETHROWER_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}That's great! You know, they say revenge is like ice cream-the colder, the better!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_FLAMETHROWER_5]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}But I think revenge is like hot pot! The hotter, the better! Fiery passion! And dip it in spicy sauce!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_FLAMETHROWER_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}And we need some Taco too!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}I am the zombie boss. I'm sending you another intimidating letter.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}You're in trouble. Big-big trouble. In fact, it's trouble from the Gargantuars!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_3]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Sloth Gargantuar smash! Smash your tiny, shivering plants!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_4]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Sloth Gargantuar deliver prehistoric plague of Imps!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_5]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Wishing you a bad day. Sincerely, Dr. Zomboss

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_6]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}I guess those zombies will never evolve.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_7]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Not even in a million, billion, or trillion years.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_HURRIKALE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}My data shows that the Hurrikale will be very useful.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_HURRIKALE_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}The wind it blows can freeze zombies and slow them down!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_HURRIKALE_3]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}This guy is really good at blowing! I mean, blowing in a fantastic way.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_ICEBLOCKS_4]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}I'm interested in this idea!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_MINIGAME_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}It's too quiet. Where did everyone go? I have a bad feeling about this.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_MINIGAME_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}My scanner shows that there are zombies hiding under the ice.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_MINIGAME_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}I know this game! They call it Hide & Eat Brains.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_MINIGAME_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Time for a game of our own: I call it Whack-A-Zombie.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_MINIGAME_5]
{SAY:WINNIE}If we beat them hard enough, they'll drop better hammers.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_MINIGAME_6]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}I'm sorry. I can't control it. I have to say it. It's hammer time!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_PEPPERPULT_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE}This place makes me feel icy cold.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_PEPPERPULT_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}My feet are really freezing.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_PEPPERPULT_3]
{PLAYFUL:WINNIE}It's time to turn on the heater. I recommend the Pepper-pult for the job.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_PEPPERPULT_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}It can throw hot peppers at zombies, keeping the surrounding zombies warm too.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_PEPPERPULT_5]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Let's pick a Pepper-pult! It's the perfect plant for our current predicament!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_PEPPERPULT_6]
{TIRED:WINNIE}Do you always have to rhyme, User Dave? Is it necessary?

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{TIRED:CRAZYDAVE}I hope these prehistoric zombies will obediently return to their caves.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_2]
{EXCITED:WINNIE}User Dave, maybe it's time to try a new strategy.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Data shows that the Stunion will be an effective ally here.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Good idea, Penny! That guy's breath can stun people!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_5]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}No exaggeration. Even zombies... can be stunned by the taste in his mouth!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_6]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Quite disgusting. But genuinely reliable!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_XSHOT_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Penny, we need a nice cup of hot cocoa now!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_XSHOT_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}User Dave, that is an unverified anti-zombie weapon.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_XSHOT_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}I recommend summoning the Rotobaga.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_XSHOT_4]
{EXCITED:WINNIE}She can float in the air and shoot zombies in four directions!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_XSHOT_5]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}This kid is talented! Perhaps she also knows how to make hot cocoa?

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:WINNIE}User Dave, I detect an ice block approaching.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Looks like a zombie-sicle to me. 

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Analysis shows that this terrifying ice block will unlock a chilling challenge.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Do you know what I would say? "Bring on the horses!"

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_ZOMBIENOTE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVEICON}{TIRED:CRAZYDAVEICON}Penny, have you ever licked a popsicle with your tongue?

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_ZOMBIENOTE_2]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIEICON}{TIRED:WINNIEICON}No, User Dave. I haven't tried it.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_ZOMBIENOTE_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVEICON}Uh... Neither have I. It must be crazy!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_ZOMBIENOTE_4]
{SAY:WINNIEICON}Well, during your tongue recovery, please pay attention to strange slabs.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_ZOMBIENOTE_5]
{SAY:WINNIEICON}It appears to be a warning sign, written in Cave Zombie.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_ZOMBIENOTE_6]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVEICON}Doesth it warn people not to lick ice-thickles?

[NARRATIVE_JACKOLANTERN_LOD_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Tap Jack O' Lantern for a burst of flame.

[NARRATIVE_JACKOLANTERN_LOD_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Tap and HOLD for an extended burst that does increasing damage!

[NARRATIVE_LAWN_MOWERS_FILL_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{EXCITED:WINNIE}Wow, the lawn mowers can chase zombies continuously!

[NARRATIVE_LAWN_MOWERS_FILL_2]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Be aware of the lawn mowers dropped by zombies, but at the same time...

[NARRATIVE_LAWN_MOWERS_FILL_3]
{SAY:CRAZYDAVE}Let me restore your lawn mower to battle form.

[NARRATIVE_LAWN_MOWERS_FILL_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Don't worry, this one's free, and it needs to be placed close to the house.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_BIG_REWARD_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}You're amazing! Truly deserving of the name... Mr. Piñata!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_BIG_REWARD_INTRO_2]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVE}Have you seen my taco, Mr. Piñata? It's about this big...

[NARRATIVE_LOD_BIG_REWARD_INTRO_3]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{TIRED}Exactly. Please destroy this anomaly before User Dave gets obsessed.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_LEVEL_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{TIRED}User Dave, this doesn't look like a party.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_LEVEL_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{PLAYFUL}But it could be a surprise party, with gifts and all!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_LEVEL_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}You'll see, Penny. I think these zombies are different.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIEICON}{EXCITED}In the modern era, your house is about to be attacked!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVEICON}{EXCITED}I bet that's not an attack... I bet it's a party! Oh, I hope it's a piñata party!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIEICON}That's not a party, it's zombies from different time and space preparing to invade!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:WINNIEICON}Who knows if they'll bring gifts along?

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_INTRO_5]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVEICON}I think it's a party! We better hurry, I don't want to miss it!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIEICON}The party is over, but the zombies will be back soon.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_OUTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVEICON}{PLAYFUL}As for them... more piñatas!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_OUTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIEICON}Continuously repelling multiple party attacks triggers a big piñata event.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_OUTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVEICON}I can't wait for the next piñata party and the activities ahead!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_OUTRO_5]
{TIRED:CRAZYDAVEICON}But those piñatas remind me of my lost sad taco. Let's go!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_RESET_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIEICON}Missing a piñata party resets the accumulation of big piñata events.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_RESET_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIEICON}I won't pretend to understand why, but the data doesn't lie.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_RESET_INTRO_3]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVEICON}{EXCITED}If you detect a piñata party, just let us know.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_RESET_INTRO_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVEICON}For parties, these parties are hard to find.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_REWARD_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}Guess what, Penny? A surprise piñata party!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_REWARD_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{TIRED}Illogical. It seems like a Level 3 diagnostic check is necessary.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_REWARD_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Piñatas! Let's open some and see what we get!

[NARRATIVE_MINIGAME_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVEICON}{SAY}Now let's break with tradition.

[NARRATIVE_MINIGAME_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVEICON}Breaker, that was awesome in the past. Tell them the right answer!

[NARRATIVE_MINIGAME_INTRO_3]
{NPC_ENTER:WINNIEICON}{TIRED}It's called Vasebreaker, User Dave. Vasebreaker.

[NARRATIVE_MINIGAME_INTRO_4]
{PLAYFUL:CRAZYDAVEICON}In that case, tell them the right jar!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Aha! Project Paradox begins... NOW!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}We've returned to the moment before we left!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_1_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}If my guess is correct, Dr. Zomboss wants to stop you from eating the taco in the first place!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_1_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE}Our journey will cease to exist!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_1_INTRO_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}NOOOOOOOOOO!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_1_INTRO_7]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}...OOOOOOOO! Sorry, I was busy screaming "No." Did you say "taco"?

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_1_INTRO_8]
{SAY:WINNIE}We must be careful, classmate User Dave. Dr. Zomboss will release various time zombies to attack us!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_1_INTRO_9]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}TACOOOOOOO!!!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_11_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}We found some Shadow Shroom seed packets, classmate User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_11_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Shadow Shrooms are plants of the Shadow family. Remember to plant them near Moonflowers for additional effects.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_11_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Victory comes from sticking together!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_15_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Look, Penny! My taco!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_15_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}No, classmate User Dave! Absolutely not! I detected high-level traps!

{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}But... hunger... food... taco!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_16_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Fool! You fell into my obvious trap!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_16_INTRO_3]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}And then I get my taco?

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_17_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Dusk Lobber is another Shadow plant, classmate User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_17_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}It can fight alone and launch explosive projectiles.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_17_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}In its empowered state, it can shoot three lanes at once!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_17_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}That's the same number as my thumbs and nose!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_19_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Escape Root is a cunning plant, classmate User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_19_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}When threatened, it turns into an explosive plant!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_19_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}If you tap on it and then tap on another plant, they will swap positions!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_19_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}You can use Escape Root to rescue endangered plants!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_19_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}What? Are all the plants going to die? Call the police quickly!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Moonflower releases sunlight, classmate User Dave. But that's not all.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}My scans show it emits special light to empower plants of the same kind.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_2_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Planting Moonflowers together should increase their power.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}I guess they will have the same effect on other Shadow plants too.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_2_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}TACOOOOOOOO!!!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_21_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}All-Star Zombies are encroaching, User Dave!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_23_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}The Grimrose is a shadow plant, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_23_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}It drags away a zombie in its lane.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_23_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}When empowered, it can take out up to three zombies before disappearing.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_23_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Looks like it tried too hard!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_24_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I heard the pitter-patter of little feet!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_24_INTRO_2]

{SAY:WINNIE}They have tremendous teamwork!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Shrinking Violet lives up to its name, classmate User Dave.

{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Don't you care about the order of every moment?

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_25_OUTRO_3]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}You imbecile! Ignoramus! Pot-headed fool!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_25_OUTRO_4]
{NPC_EXIT:ZOMBOSSICON}{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE} {EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}That's not a pot, it's a pan with a handle!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_25_OUTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE}I'm really worried, classmate User Dave. What if what he says is true?

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_25_OUTRO_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Besides the taco, I don't care about anything else, Penny! Onward!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_26_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Please, Time Zipper, you must listen to reason!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_26_INTRO_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}The continuity of time has been shattered! Our era has become meaningless!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_26_INTRO_3]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}Everything has become self-contradictory!

{NPC_ENTER:ZOMBOSSICON}I am speaking the truth, Crazy Dave!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_26_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:ZOMBOSSICON}I am not deceiving you!

{SAY:crazydave}And maybe find the Taco I've been craving for ages... Let's go!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_ICEBLOCKS_1]

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Welcome to the Steam Age! This is the 14th stop of our time travel journey.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Strange smell! The smoke coming out of these holes doesn't smell delicious like food!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}Data shows that toxic gas will come out of these holes and damage the plants.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Ahahahaha! These holes are so deep! It's triggering my fear of heights!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_6]
{SAY:WINNIE}It is said that these holes go as deep as 6666 meters.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_7]
{SAY:WINNIE}Maybe if we keep watching, something will come out of them.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_8]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}There definitely won't be anything inside the holes! Who would live in such a deep hole?

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_9]
{SAY:WINNIE}But our instruments seem to think otherwise.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_10]
{SAY:WINNIE}You can temporarily block the holes, prevent toxic gas and zombies from coming out by using Flat-shroom.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Hey, there's a gentleman just like me!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_3_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}That's the Gentleman Zombie from the Steam Age.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_3_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Hehe! Feels like I can be friends with him!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_3_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}The Gentleman Zombie can bypass the front-line plants and damage the back-line ones.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_3_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE}You can use Wind-Blowing Vanilla to blow away the Gentleman Zombie's umbrella and make him lose his special ability.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_6_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Look at all these guys holding parts in their hands! Are they really working hard?

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_6_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Of course not, these are probably all zombies.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_6_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Where's the kitchen here? I want to see if there's any delicious food!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_6_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}I don't know if there's a kitchen here! But you'll need a strong shooter to attack these zombies.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_6_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE}Lotus Shooter is a powerful long-range plant in the Steam Age. It can absorb toxic gas and also damage zombies.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_13_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I have claustrophobia! So many holes!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_13_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}The detector shows that plants or zombies will come out of these holes.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_13_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Is there a spring bed inside the holes?

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_13_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}No, there isn't.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_13_INTRO_5]

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_13_INTRO_7]

{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Is that guy carrying a boiler on his back trying to lose weight?

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_16_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}That's the Furnace Zombie. It will explode after a while.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_16_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I'm going to ask him if he feels tired carrying such a heavy thing.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_16_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}In theory, he shouldn't feel tired.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_16_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE}Using ice plants can delay the explosion time of the zombie.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_21_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Here comes a guy pushing a cart! There must be lots of delicious snacks on it!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_21_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Data shows that it's the Coal Miner Zombie.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_21_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Huh? Are those black things inked Taco? A new variety?

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_21_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}Those are not ink, they are coal that buries the zombie.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_21_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE}Using fire plants can burn the coal!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Welcome to a new temporal journey! This is the 13th century, full of artistic atmosphere in Europe - Renaissance Age.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}The scanner shows that we are inside a museum.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Do those guys' collars look like Taco? Maybe they like eating Taco too!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE}We don't know if they like Taco, but they certainly still prefer brains.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Look! What are those round things? Hmm! I guess they are a new type of taco?

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_7]
{SAY:WINNIE}Those are the Vitruvian Wheel. Properly using them will become our secret weapon against zombies!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_8]
{SAY:WINNIE}Wax Gourd Guards can assist us in using the secret weapon.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_9]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}What are those arrows on the ground? It seems like they're pointing to Taco ahead!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_10]
{SAY:WINNIE}The arrows on the ground determine the rolling direction of the rings.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Oh my goodness! The fog here is making it hard for me to open my eyes!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Our detector shows that this fog is poisonous, be careful!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Look at that guy holding a bottle, could it be a taco-flavored drink?

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}That's the Perfume Zombie, the bottles in his hand can create toxic fog that harms plants.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Oh! This darn toxic fog, I'm suffocating!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}We need a plant that can purify the toxic fog!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_7]
{SAY:WINNIE}Aloe can purify the toxic fog created by the Perfume Zombie and increase the attack power of plants.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I see many incredible statues here, it's so interesting! Haha!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Oh! Look at those stone statues!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}This is really interesting, hahaha! I bet they turned into statues because they stole Taco!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}Those are statue zombies. They will turn into real zombies at night, so we need to smash them during the day!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE}Beware when night falls.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Hey! What's that guy who looks like he's carving doing?

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}That's the Sculptor Imp Zombie. It can carve a zombie out of raw stone.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Looks fun. I think I have the talent to become a sculptor too!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}Data shows your success rate has decreased by 99.9999% in this field.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE}Destroying the raw stones in advance can prevent the Sculptor Imp Zombie from carving out zombies.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_14_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Those guys, their clothes look so strange, and they don't walk properly! I bet they're drunk!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_14_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Those are Ballerina Zombie, they always appear in groups of four.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_14_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Terrifying setup, do four people really need to share one taco? If that's the case, I'd rather be alone...

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_14_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}Using Oily Olive can stop the fast-moving Ballerina Zombie.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_16_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Look at those stone statues!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_16_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Those are statue zombies. They will turn into real zombies at night, so we need to smash them during the day, using tools!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_16_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}This is really interesting, hahaha! I bet they must have stolen and eaten Taco!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_16_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}Note that the number of tools is limited.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Wow! This place looks like it has a lot of wasabi-flavored Taco!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Welcome to a new time-travel journey! This is Japan during the Heian period in the 10th century - Heian Age.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Our detector shows that we are inside a shrine near Mount Fuji.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Look at those guys' hairstyles, don't they look like Taco? Maybe they actually hide Taco in their hair!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE}According to the scan analysis, there are no hidden Taco in their hair, and they are all wearing wigs.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Quick, look! What's in that box over there? Oh! I guess it's a lunch box for Taco?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_7]
{SAY:WINNIE}That's a money chest. By using different money chests strategically, they will help you deal with zombies more effectively!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_8]
{SAY:WINNIE}Of course, you need to "insert coins" first. Oh, I mean your sun's plant food.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_9]
{SAY:WINNIE}The Saisen Boxes can return some sunlight to the nearby planted plants.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Oh my! They're holding chimneys in their hands, and they even emit fire!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Warning, those are Firework Zombies. The fireworks they spray will set us on fire!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Wow! This fiery feeling, did they add hot sauce inside?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}Drops of Dripping Diphylleia can extinguish the fireworks sprayed by the firework tubes.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}What are we waiting for? Let's go!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Oh! This is an extraordinary money chest. Does it contain Taco this time?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_3_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Pay attention to the pattern on the money chest. This one is an Saisen Boxes, and it allows nearby plants to unleash their ultimate abilities together.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_4_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Are there any other chests? I hope there's one that can hold Taco!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_4_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Dear User Dave, forget about the Taco for now. This is a Saisen Boxes.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_4_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}It can provide you with a high-level plant to help you deal with strong zombies.

Tyrant Zombie
[ZOMBIE_DARK_KING_ELITE_DESCRIPTION_HEADER]
The Elite Dark King Zombie has a resilience bar mechanism; physical attacks can reduce its resilience (stunning effects can cause high reductions). Emptying the resilience bar puts the zombie into a weakened state, during which the zombie will not act or attack until the resilience bar is fully restored. While the zombie has resilience, it provides damage absorption limits.

[ZOMBIE_DARK_KING_ELITE_DESCRIPTION]
In that dark age ruled by foolishness, generations of zombies struggled and finally discovered a way to use heavy gold to stun their monarch, thereby helping the monarch to sleep soundly. This great new era was called the Golden Age by zombie historians.

[ZOMBIE_DARK_WIZARD_ELITE_DESCRIPTION]
At a certain wizard conference, a well-informed wizard zombie suggested that a magic book could be used to prop up a table corner. This shocked all the zombies present.
From then on, those who successfully learned this advanced technology became the elite among wizard zombies.

Your total score is based on the damage done to snowmen within a limited time. Points earned from the latest levels contribute to daily bonus missions that refresh every day. Three themes—firepower test, accuracy test, and tactical test—are unlocked in sequence, each with three levels, every two days for levels and six days for themes. The leaderboard ranks players based on the total scores from the three latest theme levels. After a new theme unlocks, there’s an anti cheat detection period from 0:00 to 10:00 when players cannot access the new levels; only scores from up-to-date levels are counted. Rewards are automatically issued post-ranking, and any detected abnormal scores will be excluded. The leaderboard will be visible for one day on March 30th, during which no level challenges are allowed.
